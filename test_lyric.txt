I can't begin to tell you how much you mean to me
My world would end if ever we were through
I can't begin to tell you how happy I would be
If I could speak my mind like others do

I make such pretty speeches
Whenever we're apart
But when you're near, the words I choose
Refuse to leave my heart

So take the sweetest phrases the world has ever known
And make believe I've said 'em all to you

I make such pretty speeches
Whenever we're apart
But when you're near, the words I choose
Refuse to leave my heart

So take the sweetest phrases the world has ever known
And make believe I've said 'em all to you
